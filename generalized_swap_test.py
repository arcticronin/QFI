        # (ρ, σ, ρ, σ) conditioned on the ancilla being |1>[cite: 317].
        # Effectively, it applies the permutation (ρ_1, σ_1, ρ_2, σ_2) -> (σ_2, ρ_1, σ_1, ρ_2)
        # conditioned on the ancilla.

        # PennyLane doesn't have a direct n-qubit cyclic permutation gate.
        # We simulate the Sn action for (rho_wires_1, sigma_wires_1, rho_wires_2, sigma_wires_2)
        # conditioned on the ancilla.
        # The permutation action is (i, j, k, l) -> (j, k, l, i) on the data qubits[cite: 329].
        # This requires swapping. A controlled swap can be implemented with CNOTs and Toffoli.

        # Implement C_Sn where Sn permutes (rho_wires_1, sigma_wires_1, rho_wires_2, sigma_wires_2)
        # to (sigma_wires_2, rho_wires_1, sigma_wires_1, rho_wires_2)
        # This is a conceptual implementation. Realistically, you'd use controlled swaps
        # or a custom controlled permutation. For simplicity, let's denote the conceptual
        # ControlledPermutation gate here.
        # The paper mentions 'generalized SWAP test' which refers to this controlled permutation[cite: 325].
        # For n=2, Sn is simply the SWAP operator[cite: 330].

        # For a general 'n' subsystem qubits, implementing Sn might be complex.
        # The paper describes Sn as permuting psi_1, psi_2, ..., psi_n to psi_n, psi_1, ..., psi_{n-1}[cite: 329].
        # In the context of Fig. 6, it acts on the concatenated register of 4*n qubits.
        # The circuit applies H, then controlled Sn, then H, then measures the ancilla[cite: 317].

        # For the Tr[ρσρσ] calculation as derived in (A22) of the paper, the final probability
        # of measuring |0> on the ancilla is p(0) = 0.5 + 0.5 * Tr[ρσρσ][cite: 338].
        # This implies a controlled SWAP-like operation on the *entire* 4n-qubit block.
        # The 'Sn' in Fig. 6 acts as a cyclic shift on the *indices* of the combined density matrix.
        # This is conceptually a controlled version of the operation that calculates Tr[ABCD].

        # Let's use a simpler approach that PennyLane often enables for such quantities
        # where we calculate the expectation value of a SWAP-like operator.
        # However, the question specifically asks for the circuit as per Fig. 6,
        # which implies a destructive SWAP test variant.

        # As per Appendix A.3[cite: 323]:
        # The operator S_n acts on a tensor product basis for n-qubits.
        # The circuit in Fig. 6 is for a general form of Tr[ρσρσ].
        # The probability of measuring the ancilla qubit in the |0> state is
        # p(0) = 1/2 + 1/2 * Tr[ρσρσ][cite: 338].

        # To implement the controlled Sn (cyclic shift operator) for the specific form Tr[ρσρσ]:
        # The operator performs (i,j,k,l) -> (j,k,l,i)[cite: 329].
        # This means, for each corresponding qubit from the four n-qubit registers,
        # (q_rho1, q_sigma1, q_rho2, q_sigma2) becomes (q_sigma2, q_rho1, q_sigma1, q_rho2).

        # For each of the num_subsystem_qubits in parallel:
        for i in range(num_subsystem_qubits):
            # This is a conceptual representation of the controlled cyclic shift
            # for 4 registers of 1 qubit each.
            # Controlled by ancilla: apply permutation on (rho_wires_1[i], sigma_wires_1[i],
            #                                           rho_wires_2[i], sigma_wires_2[i])
            # to (sigma_wires_2[i], rho_wires_1[i], sigma_wires_1[i], rho_wires_2[i])
            # This is typically done using controlled SWAP gates.

            # PennyLane does not have a direct n-qubit controlled cyclic shift for arbitrary n.
            # For demonstration, we'll indicate this conceptual step.
            # A full implementation would involve decompositions into CNOTs and Toffolis.
            # Example for one qubit (n=1) case for Tr[ABCD]:
            # CNOT(ancilla, sigma_wires_2[i]) if we want to move its state
            # Controlled(ancilla, qml.SWAP)(wires=[rho_wires_1[i], sigma_wires_2[i]]) might be one step
            # This is complex and might be specific to PennyLane's internal operations for derivatives.
            # The paper states "a controlled permutation gate, whose circuit depth scales linearly in the number of qubits"[cite: 131].

            # For the purpose of providing the circuit as described in Fig. 6:
            # We assume a conceptual `qml.ControlledPermutation` operation for simplicity
            # since the exact decomposition can be very specific and complex for general n.
            # A common way to implement controlled arbitrary unitary is through a controlled multi-qubit gate.
            # qml.Controlled(qml.QubitPermutation(np.array([3,0,1,2]), wires=[rho_wires_1[i], sigma_wires_1[i], rho_wires_2[i], sigma_wires_2[i]]), control_wire=ancilla)
            # This is more direct for a single qubit.

            # Let's consider the abstract S_n for the four n-qubit registers.
            # The diagram implies a single C-S_n gate for the entire block.
            # PennyLane provides `qml.Permute` for permutation, but not directly 'controlled'.
            # A controlled version would be:

            )
            # This is still a simplified example for the cyclic shift.
            # A proper controlled permutation involves a sequence of controlled SWAPs.
            # For example, to shift (A,B,C,D) to (D,A,B,C):
            # C_SWAP(ancilla, A, D)
            # C_SWAP(ancilla, A, C)
            # C_SWAP(ancilla, A, B)
            # And then repeat for other elements. This gets complicated quickly.

            # The key is that the paper claims this is "efficiently estimated on a quantum computer
            # requiring up to 4n+1 qubits" and circuit depth "scales linearly in the number of qubits"[cite: 82, 323, 325].
            # PennyLane's `qml.ControlledPhaseShift` or `qml.Controlled` operations can be used
            # with custom unitaries if the direct permutation is not available as a primitive.

            # For the general case of Tr[ρσρσ], the controlled permutation Sn is applied.
            # This would apply the permutation (rho_wires_1[i], sigma_wires_1[i], rho_wires_2[i], sigma_wires_2[i])
